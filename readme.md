# BU Clothing Website Markdown

### This project was done by Aleksandr Burkatovskiy, Yergali Askarbayev, Mohammed Motahar Hasnat and Yuze Li for the course METCS 632/432 in Boston University MET college in fall semester 2018.



The main goal is to create a website to sell Boston University themed things. We will need to be able to sell a variety of products ranging from clothing to school supplies. The clothing will include shirts, sweatshirts, hats, watches, portable charger, calculator and so on. For now, this website program is only able to run locally because the whole program is only based on HTML, css and the function part is constructed in javascript.



For now, users will be able to log in,view items, put merchandises into their shopping carts, view shopping cart or delete items and also do the payment with their credit cards. As for other additional functions, users can view their personal profiles and view items on the product page using filters like category or simply use keywords as a filter.
